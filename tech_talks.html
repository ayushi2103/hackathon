                <p>Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg looks at why a smaller percentage of women than men reach the top of
                    their professions and offers 3 powerful pieces of advice to women aiming for the C-suite.
                </p>
                <p>Throughout her talk, Sheryl Sandberg touches on the problems that women face at work and the
                    obstacles holding them back. But it was a rousing statement that prompted applause and cheers
                    from
                    the female members of the audience.</p>

                <p> “Success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women,”
                    she
                    says, encapsulating and confirming the truth that women in the workplace have long-known to be
                    true.
                    Being likeable and successful is difficult, if not entirely impossible in workplace environments
                    where the glass ceiling is so low women can only crawl towards equality.</p>

                <p>Led by the founder of Girls Who Code, Reshma Saujani discusses the societal expectations of boy and
                    girls, and how these expectations can affect their career choices. By instilling in young girls the
                    idea they should strive for perfection, she argues, they learn to settle for what ensures success,
                    rather than taking the risks needed to propel women forward in work and in life.
                </p>
                <p>“The difference is in how boys and girls approach a challenge. And it doesn’t just end in fifth
                    grade,” Saujani states. “An HP report found that men will apply for a job if they meet only 60% of
                    the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100% of the qualifications.”</p>

                <p> If there’s anything women need to learn from men here, it’s to believe in your own self-worth. And
                    this is coming from someone who never wrote about software or IT management and applied to Capterra
                    anyway. Because I believed in myself and my abilities, which was mostly due to another female
                    professional believing in me as well.</p>

                <p>If you’re a woman with the odds stack against you and you need some examples of female resilience,
                    look no further than Dame Stephanie Shirley, a Jewish refugee during WWII, the founder of a software
                    company in the early 1960’s, and the mother of an autistic child, who later passed away.
                </p>
                <p>“You can always tell ambitious women by the shape of our heads,” she says. “They’re flat on top for
                    being patted patronizingly. And we have larger feet to stand away from the kitchen sink.”

                <p>Heartbreaking and poignant, this TED Talk is sure to touch any female professional juggling and
                    struggling with the role of business leader and parent. But as Anne-Marie Slaughter argues, when
                    push comes to shove, family life should win out, especially since it can even help your career.
                </p>
                <p>“I suggest that real equality, full equality, does not just mean valuing women on male terms,”
                    Slaughter states. “It means creating a much wider range of equally respected choices for women and
                    for men. And to get there, we have to change our workplaces, our policies and our culture….In the
                    workplace, real equality means valuing family just as much as work, and understanding that the two
                    reinforce each other.”</p>

                <p> Slaughter takes off on a logic-based argument, presenting the notion that those who value their
                    family before career also bring a “wider range of experiences and contacts,” since they socialize at
                    their children’s events, a sort of a parent-based networking.</p>
